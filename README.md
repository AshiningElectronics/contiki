The Contiki Operating System with stm32-bv support
==================================================

This version of contiki adds support for the stm32f4 mcu and my stm32-bv
motes.

You can read about the hardware and get all the design files here:

I'm currently writing a post about the process of porting contiki to the
stm32f4. I will add a link to that post here when I'm done.
